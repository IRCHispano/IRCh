# ircd.conf  configuration file for ircd version ircu2.9.mu and ircu2.10
#
# Written by Niels <niels@undernet.org>, based on the original example.conf,
# server code and some real-life (ahem) experience.
#
# Thanks and credits to: Run, Trillian, Cym, Morrissey, Chaos, Flynn,
#                        Xorath, WildThang, Mmmm, SeKs, Ghostwolf and
#                        all other Undernet IRC Admins and Operators,
#                        and programmers working on the Undernet ircd.

# This is an example of the configuration file used by the Undernet ircd.
#
# This document is based on a (fictious) server in Europe with a
# connection to the Undernet IRC network. It is primarily a leaf server,
# but if all the other hubs in Europe aren't in service, it can connect
# to one in the US by itself.
#
# All configuration options start with a letter identifying the option,
# and a colon separated list of options. An asterisk indicates an
# unused field.
#
# Please note that when ircd puts the configuration lines into practice,
# it parses them exactly the other way round than they are listed here.
# This means that you should start your I: lines with the "fall through",
# most vanilla one and end with the most detailed.
#
# There is a difference between the ``hostname'' and the ``server name''
# of the machine that the server is run on. For example, the host can
# have ``veer.cs.vu.nl'' as FQDN, and ``Amsterdam.NL.EU.undernet.org'' as
# server name.
# A ``server mask'' is something like '*.EU.UnderNet.org'', which is
# matched by 'Amsterdam.NL.EU.undernet.org' but not by
# 'Manhattan.KS.US.undernet.org'.

#
# First some information about the server.
# M:<server name>:<virtual ip>:<description>:<server port>:<server numeric>
#
# The <virtual ip> must be either be empty, contain a "*", or contain
# the IP address of an interface on your system. If it contains an address,
# the address will be bound to if you have specified virtual hosting.
#
# The <server port> is the port that other servers can connect to.
# Client ports need to be specified with a P: line, see below.
#
# Note that <server numeric> has to be unique on the network your server
# is running on, must be between 1 and 64, and is not updated on a rehash.

# M:London.UK.Eu.UnderNet.org:127.0.0.1:University of London, England:4400:1
M:London.UK.Eu.UnderNet.org:*:University of London, England:4400:1

#
# This sets information that can be retrieved with the /ADMIN command.
# It should contain at least an admin Email contact address.

#
# All connections to the server are associated with a certain ``connection
# class'', be they incoming or outgoing (initiated by the server), be they
# clients, servers or Martians. (Note that ircd doesn't have direct support
# for Martians (yet?); they will have to register as normal users. ;-)
# Take the following Y: lines only as a guide.
# Y:<class>:<ping freq>:<connect freq>:<maximum links>:<sendq size>

# Server classes: 90 = all your uplinks for who you do not wish to hub;
# else in classes 80 and/or 70.
# 50 = leaf servers (only used if your server is a hub)

Y:80:90:300:1:1700000
Y:70:90:300:1:1700000
Y:50:90:300:10:1700000

# Client classes. 10 = locals; 2 = for all .net and .com that are not
# in Europe; 1 = for everybody.

#
# To allow clients to connect, they need authorization. This can be
# done based on hostmask, address mask, and/or with a password.
# With intelligent use of classes and the maxconnections field in the
# Y: lines, you can let in a specific domain, but get rid of all other
# domains in the same toplevel, thus setting up some sort of 'reverse
# K: line'.
# I:<IP mask or crap to force resolving>:<opt passwd>:<hostmask>::<class>

# Technical description (for examples, see below):
# For every connecting client, the IP-number is know.  A reverse lookup
# on this IP-number is done to get the (/all) hostname(s).
# Each hostname that belongs to this IP-number is matched to <hostmask>,
# and the I: line is used when any matches; the client will then show
# with this particular hostname.  If none of the hostnames matches, then
# the IP-number is matched against the <IP mask ...> field, if this matches
# then the I: line is used nevertheless and the client will show with the
# first (main) hostname if any; if the IP-number did not resolve then the
# client will show with the dot notation of the IP-number.
# There is a special case for the UNIX domain sockets and localhost connections
# though; in this case the <IP mask ...> field is compared with the
# name of the server (thus not with any IP-number representation). The name
# of the server is the one returned in the numeric 002 reply, for example:
# 002 Your host is 2.undernet.org[jolan.ppro], running version ...
# Then the "jolan.ppro" is the name used for matching.
# Therefore, unix domain sockets, and connections to localhost would
# match this I: line:
# I:jolan.ppro::foobar::1
# Finally, I: lines with empty <IP mask ..> or <hostmask> fields are skipped.

# This is the 'fallback' entry. All .uk, .nl, and all unresolved are
# in these two lines.
# By using two different lines, multiple connections from a single IP
# are only allowed from hostnames which have both valid forward and
# reverse DNS mappings.

# Now list all the .com / .net domains that you wish to have access...
# actually it's less work to do it this way than to do it the other
# way around - K: lining every single ISP in the US.
# I wish people in Holland just got a .nl domain, and not try to be
# cool and use .com...

# You can request a more complete listing, including the "list of standard

# You can put a digit (0..9) in the password field, which will make ircd
# only accept a client when the total number of connections to the network
# from the same IP number doesn't exceed this number.
# The following example would accept at most one connection per IP number
# from "*.swipnet.se" and at most two connections from dial up accounts
# that have "dial??.*" as host mask:
# I:Resolved:1:*@*.swipnet.se::1
# I:Resolved:2:*@dial??.*::1

#
# It is possible to show a different Message of the Day to a connecting
# client depending on its origin.

#
# One of the many nice features of Undernet is ``Uworld'', a program
# connected to the net as a server. This allows it to broadcast any mode
# change, thus allowing opers to, for example, 'unlock' a channel that
# has been taken over.
# There is only one slight problem: the TimeStamp protocol prevents this.
# So there is a configuration option to allow them anyway from a certain
# server.
# Note: (1) These lines are agreed on by every server admin on Undernet;
# (2) These lines must be the same on every single server, or results
# will be disasterous; (3) This is a useful feature, not something that
# is a liability and abused regularly (well... :-)
# If you're on Undernet, you MUST have these lines. I cannnot stress
# this enough.
# As of ircu2.10.05 is it possible to Jupe nicks. Juped nicks need to be
# added to U: lines.  As per CFV-0095, the following nicks must be juped,
# it is not allowed to jupe others as well.

# While running your server, you will most probably encounter individuals
# or groups of persons that you do not wish to have access to your server.
#
# For this purpose, the ircd understands "kill lines".
# K:<host/IP mask>:"<opt reason>":<username mask>
#
# It is possible to use a file as comment for the ban.
# K:<host/IP mask>:!<path to file>:<usermask>
#
# The default reason is: "You are banned from this server"
# Note that K: lines are local to the server; if you ban a person or a
# whole domain from your server, they can get on IRC via any other server
# that doesn't have them K: lined (yet).

# With a simple comment, using quotes:
K:*.au:"Please use a nearer server":*
K:*.edu:"Please use a nearer server":*

# With a file, prepending a '!' before the filename.
# The file can contain for example, a reason, a link to the
# server rules and a contact address.

# IP-based kill lines are designated with a lowercase 'k'.  These lines
# use the same format as normal K: lines, except they apply to all hosts,
# even if an IP address has a properly resolving host name.

#
# A more flexible way of restricting access to your server is the use
# of "restriction lines". These tell the server to start up an (external)
# program, upon whose output is decided whether the client is allowed
# access. The program should print "Y" or "N <reason>" on its stdout.
# Note that the use of R: lines is discouraged and deprecated, needs a
# compile-time define, eats CPU cycles and may well be taken out in
# future releases of ircd.
# R:<host/IP mask>:<program name>:<username mask>

#
# You probably want your server connected to other servers, so your users
# have other users to chat with.
# IRC servers connect to other servers forming a network with a star or
# tree topology. Loops are not allowed.
# In this network, two servers can be distinguished: "hub" and "leaf"
# servers. Leaf servers connect to hubs; hubs connect to each other.
# Of course, many servers can't be directly classified in one of these
# categories. Both a fixed and a rule-based decision making system for
# server links is provided for ircd to decide what links to allow, what
# to let humans do themselves, and what links to (forcefully) disallow.
#
# The Connection and Allowing connection lines (also known as C/N lines)
# define what servers the server connect to, and which servers are
# allowed to connect. Note that they come in pairs; they do not work if
# one if present and the other is absent.
# C:<remote hostname or IP>:<password>:<remote server name>:<port>:<class>
# N:<remote hostname or IP>:<password>:<remote server name>:<hostmask>:<class>
#
# If you wish to use ident, prepend "username@" to the hostname or IP
# address (the first field).
# If the "port" field is omitted, the server will not attempt to
# establish a link with that server ("not autoconnecting").
# The (optional) "host mask" field tells the server to represent itself
# with "hostmask" dot-seperateed fields stripped from its servername
# and replace it with "*.".
# For example, if hostmask == 2 and the local server name is
# "irc.sub.domain.com" it would be sent as "*.domain.com". This allows
# for easier routing and linking of new servers.
# This feature is not used on Undernet.

# Our primary uplink.
C:1.2.3.4:passwd:Amsterdam.NL.Eu.UnderNet.org:4400:90
N:1.2.3.4:passwd:Amsterdam.NL.Eu.UnderNet.org::90

#
# If your server starts on a bit larger network, you'll probably get
# assigned one or two uplinks to which your server can connect.
# If your uplink(s) also connect to other servers than yours (which is
# probable), you need to define your uplink as being allowed to "hub".
# H:<allowed hostmask>::<server name>
H:*.*::Amsterdam.NL.Eu.UnderNet.org

#
# Of course, the opposite is also possible: forcing a server to be
# a leaf. L: lines follow Murphy's Law: if you use them, there's a big
# chance that routing will be screwed up afterwards.
# L:<opt disallowed hostmask>::<server mask>:<opt max depth>

#
# For an advanced, real-time rule-based routing decision making system
# you can use Disallow lines. For more information, see doc/readme.crules.

# d:<server mask that ircd will not autoconnect to>::<rule>

# The following line is recommended for leaf servers:
d:*::directcon(*)

#
# Inevitably, you have reached the part about "IRC Operators". Oper status
# grants some special privileges to a user, like the power to make the
# server break or (try to) establish a connection with another server,
# and to "kill" users off IRC.
# I can write many pages about this; I will restrict myself to saying that
# if you want to appoint somebody as IRC Operator on your server, that
# person should be aware of his/her responsibilities, and that you, being
# the admin, will be held accountable for their actions.
#
# There are two sorts of IRC Operators: "local" and "global". Local opers
# can squit, connect and kill - but only locally: their +o user mode
# is not not passed along to other servers. On Undernet, this prevents
# them from using Uworld as well.
# Depending on some defines in include/config.h, local operators are also
# not allowed to /DIE and /RESTART the server.
# Local operators are designated with a lowercase 'o'
# O:<host/IP mask>:<encrypted password>:<Nick>::<connection class>
# o:<host/IP mask>:<encrypted password>:<Nick>::<connection class>

O:*@*.cs.vu.nl:VRKLKuGKn0jLs:Niels::10

# Note that the <connection class> is optional, but leaving it away
# puts the O: lines in class 0, which usually only accepts one connection
# at a time.  If you want users to Oper up more then once per O: line,
# then use a connection class that allows more then one connection,
# for example (using class 10 as in the example above):
# Y:10:90:0:100:160000
#
# When your server gets fuller, you will notice delays when trying to
# connect to your server's primary listening port. Via the Port lines
# it is possible to specify additional ports (both AF_UNIX and AF_INET)
# for ircd to listen to.
# De facto ports are: 6667 - standard; 6660-6669 - additional client
# ports;
#
# These are just hints, they are in no way official IANA or IETF policies.
#
# On a side note, the /UPING command uses port 7007/udp. If your server
# is located behind a firewall, you may want to make another hole in it
# for this port.
