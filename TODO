Undernet Server TODO List
This list contains things that still need to be done.

Remember:
Premature optimisation is the root of all evil - Knuth
Debugging is at least twice as difficult as programming.  So if you
write a program that uses all of your ability, you'll never be able
to debug it all.

High Priority:

* something is leaking "a meg a minute" with heap debugging on
  with 1300+ clients
  (No idea)
* add_Target in s_user.c turns pointers to ints
  this doesn't make much sence on alpha where sizeof(void *) != sizeof(int)

Medium Priority:
* crule parser coredumps on invalid input
* why do the allocation counts change the first time you rehash
  after a server boot without changing the conf file:
  *** Allocations:  416(41848)
  *** ircd.conf : Rehashing
  *** Allocations:  424(42006)
  *** ircd.conf : Rehashing
  *** Allocations:  424(42006)

* Use numeric nicks for numeric replies to remote clients
* Finish message handlers.
* Clean up ircd.conf processing, lots of sub issues.
* Implement PROTOCOL handshaking

* Prepare network code to handle even more connections:

* Implement zlib compression for server links.
* Cleanups, lots of them.
* Document undernet protocol as it is used in
  doc/rfc1459.unet
* Finish tokenization.
